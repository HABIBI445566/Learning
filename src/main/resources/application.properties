# Database connection URL. This configures an in-memory H2 database.
# `jdbc:h2:mem:dcbapp` means it will be in memory, and the database will be discarded when the application stops.
# You can change it to `jdbc:h2:file:./data/dcbapp` for file-based persistence between restarts.

# The JDBC driver class name for H2 database. This tells Spring Boot to use the H2 database driver.

# Username for connecting to the H2 database. `sa` (system administrator) is the default user for H2.

# Password for the database user. In this case, it's just `password`, but you can change it for security if needed.

# This property tells Hibernate (the JPA provider) which database dialect to use.
# The H2Dialect is designed for H2 databases and helps generate SQL compatible with H2.
#spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect

# This property determines how Hibernate handles database schema changes.
# - `update` means Hibernate will automatically update the schema if there are changes in your entities.
# - Other options are `create` (creates the schema on startup), `create-drop` (creates and drops on exit), or `none`.
# In production, you might want to switch this to `validate` or `none` to avoid unintentional schema changes.
